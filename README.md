## AudioBootLoader
You can download very easily different synthizer apps when you have installed the AudioBootLoader on your Attiny85.

The AudioBootloader was orignially programmed for an Atmega8 or Atmega168. 
Special thanks to [Ioyk](https://github.com/ATtinyTeenageRiot) for his work to rework it for Attiny85.

The Attiny85 is connected simply to the AudioOutput of your PC by the following schematic:
